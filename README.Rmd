# `rromeo` – an R interface for SHERPA/RoMEO data

[![Project Status: WIP – Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip) [![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/Rekyt/rromeo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Rekyt/rromeo)

The goal of `rromeo` is to provide an R client for the [SHERPA/RoMEO API](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php?la=en&fIDnum=&mode=simple). The API documentation can be found [here](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/apimanual.php?la=en&fIDnum=|&mode=simple).

## Installation

You can install the development version of rromeo with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("Rekyt/rromeo")
```

## API Key

Note that SHERPA/RoMEO lets you run 500 requests per day per IP address, by [registring for a free API key](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/apiregistry.php) you can bypass this limit.

`rromeo` will provide a mechanism by which you can use your key to access the API.
